Hmph. What a boring menu. We should make this much more user friendly
by applying styles (with Hick's Law and Fitts' Law in mind).

Some tips to get you started: Use Chrome Dev Tools to see what kind of
elements (block or inline) you are working with. Do they have margins,
padding by default? What display properties could you change these to?

Before you start worrying about how the links and hover effects work,
get the list items displayed in one line. Then work from there to add
your margin, border, padding, etc.
